//*      OS/390 V2.10 introduced a CUT/PASTE command in edit.       *   FILE 580
//*      It is a trivial implementation of the CUT/PASTE macros     *   FILE 580
//*      from the PDS product from File 182 of the CBT Tape.        *   FILE 580
//*                                                                 *   FILE 580
//*      I used the PDS (File 182) CUT/PASTE macros as a base;      *   FILE 580
//*      converted them to REXX and enhanced them a "little".       *   FILE 580
//*                                                                 *   FILE 580
//*      The SHOWCUT macro will display a table of all cut          *   FILE 580
//*      tables and will display the contents of the table.         *   FILE 580
//*                                                                 *   FILE 580
//*      The ZPASTE function has been enhanced to provide a         *   FILE 580
//*      multiple-paste operation when invoked with ZPASTE AFTER    *   FILE 580
//*      NX/X or ZPASTE BEFORE NX/X.                                *   FILE 580
