Sam,

OS/390 V2.10 introduced a CUT/PASTE command in edit.  It is a
trivial implementation of the CUT/PASTE macros from the PDS share
product.

I used the PDS share CUT/PASTE macros as a base; converted them
to REXX and enhanced them a "little".

The Showcut macro will display a table of all cut tables and will
display the contents of the table.

The ZPASTE function has been enhanced to provide a multiple-paste
operation when invoked with ZPASTE AFTER NX/X or ZPASTE BEFORE
NX/X.

The CUT.XMI is a TSO xmit of a PDS per your specifications. There
is a trivial $INSTALL member to perform the required IEBCOPY
steps.
