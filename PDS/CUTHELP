%                     CUT Prompt and Set Defaults
+
   The ZCUT and ZPASTE Edit macros provide a handy method to move data
   from one Edit session to another.  The%ZCUT Default+panel provides
   the fields for selecting the%MODE+for the ZCUT operation and for
   setting the default options for both ZCUT and ZPASTE during future
   operations.  The%MODE+for the ZCUT operation is ether REPLACE or ADD.

   The table name can also be set for this request as well as the limit
   on the number of lines that are allowed to be saved.  The default
   options for the request can also be set.  Also the default options
   for ZPASTE macro can be set to ZERO or KEEP.

                 ¢General information on ZCUT and ZPASTE+
+
   The ZCUT and ZPASTE Edit macros provides a handy method to move data
   from one Edit session to another. The ZCUT macro saves lines from an
   Edit session. The ZPASTE macro places these lines into another Edit
   session (or the same session).

   The ZCUT macro can combine data lines with previously saved data
   lines.  This is called ADD or APPEND mode.  The ZPASTE macro can
   place these lines into one or more Edit sessions. The ZCUT table
   data lines are saved when KEEP mode is active.  The Edit sessions can
   be on different screens and/or Edit sessions started at a later time
   provided you do not exit ISPF.

   The macros use a temporary ISPF table to store/retrieve the data
   lines.  The tables are defined with a two character table name.
   Multiple tables can be active at the same time.  The SHOWCUT macro
   will display the active ZCUT tables.

                   ¢Common operands for ZCUT and ZPASTE+
+
   The ZCUT and ZPASTE macro have several optional operands.

   The operands P or PROMPT, D or DEFAULTS provide menu panels for
   entering the optional operands.  The operands H or HELP can be used
   to provide access to this panel.

   The lines from the ZCUT macro are saved in an ISPF table.  A two
   character operand is used to name the table for the saved lines.
   Multiple tables can be created. Just remember the two character table
   name operand! The SHOWCUT macro will display all of the ZCUT tables
   created during the current ISPF session.

   A two character operand on the ZPASTE macro recalls the lines stored
   in the ZCUT table.

   The table name will default if not provided.  This default can be
   changed with the (D)efault or (P)rompt operand.

   A numeric operand sets the limit for the number of lines saved in the
   table during a ZCUT.  Region size is the limiting factor.

  %Select the lines to be saved, either MOVE or COPY.+
      The ZCUT macro works with the Edit line commands for MOVE/COPY
      in their several forms (M, MM, Mn, C, CC, Cn) to specify which
      group of data lines to copy (and delete if move is specified).

  %Set the MODE for the ZCUT execution, either ADD or REPLACE.+
      The operand A or ADD for the ZCUT macro specifies that the
      selected lines are to be added to any already saved lines in
      the named ZCUT table.

      The operand R or REPLACE for the ZCUT macro specifies that the
      lines selected are to replace or overlay any lines already saved.

      The default, if not changed, is ADD.

  %Specify where to save the lines, either
      a two character table name
      or the default table name.+

      The lines from the ZCUT macro are saved in an ISPF table. A two
      character operand is used to name the table for the saved lines.
      Multiple tables can be created. Just remember the two character
      table name operand! The SHOWCUT macro will display the list of
      created ZCUT tables.

  %Specify a limit for the number of lines to copy.+
      A numeric operand specifying the limit for the number of lines
      to be saved in the table during a ZCUT.  Region size is the
      limiting factor.


                         ¢How to use ZPASTE+

   The data lines from the ZCUT macro are saved in an ISPF table.  A two
   character operand is used to name the table for the saved lines.
   These lines are inserted into the edit session based on the ZPASTE
   operands specified.

   A two character operand on the ZPASTE macro recalls the lines stored
   in the ZCUT table.

       The table name will default if not provided.  This default can be
       changed with the (D)efault or (P)rompt operand.

   The "post" ZPASTE action for the ZCUT table.  This is called the
   ZPASTE MODE.

   A Before/After operand can be used with the X/NX operand.

   A X/NX operand can be used to execute the paste operation multiple
   times based on the eXcluded or Non-eXcluded status of the data lines.

  %Specify the table name containing the data lines to be restored,
      a two character table name
      or the default table name.+

      The lines from the ZCUT macro are saved in a table. Specify the
      two character name of the table to use for the ZPASTE.
      The lines from the ZCUT macro are saved in an ISPF table. A two
      character operand is used to name the table containing the saved
      lines.  Multiple tables can be created. Just remember the two
      character table name operand! The SHOWCUT macro will display the
      list of created ZCUT tables.

  %Set the MODE for the ZPASTE excution, either ZERO or KEEP.+
      The operand Z or ZERO specifies that the table is to be cleared
      after the lines have been inserted.

      The operand K or KEEP specifies that the table is not to be
      cleared, thus the saved lines are to be kept for future ZPASTE
      requests or to be added to by other ZCUT requests.

      The default, if not changed, is ZERO.

  %Specify where to insert the saved lines:
      After or Before line command,
      After or Before Excluded lines operand,
      After or Before Non-Excluded lines operand.
+
     %After or Before line command,+
      This is a single paste execution.  The ZPASTE macro works with the
      Edit line commands for After or Before (A or B).  This specifies a
      single paste execution either (B)efore the line line specified or
      (A)fter the line speciified.

      All lines previously saved will be inserted.

     %After or Before operand,+
      This is a multiple paste execution.  The data lines previously
      saved will be inserted multiple times. The default is After.

     %X or NX operand,+
      This is a multiple paste execution.  The data lines previously
      saved will be inserted multiple times.

      The X (or excluded) operand will paste the ZCUT data lines either
      After or Before each of the blocks of excluded lines contained
      within the edit session.

      The NX (or non-excluded) operand will paste the ZCUT data lines
      either After or Before each of the visble or non-excluded data
      lines contained within the edit session.


               ¢Modes of Operation using ZCUT and ZPASTE+
+
      The use of the operands ADD, REPLACE, ZERO, and KEEP define the mode
      for the ZCUT and ZPASTE macros.

      The most common mode could be called the "gather mode" with operands
      ADD and ZERO.  This is where several groups of lines are gathered from
      here and there and finally pasted into one member.

      The other mode could be called the "distribution mode" where one
      group of lines is collected and then placed in several members or
      in several spots in one member.  This uses the operands REPLACE
      and KEEP.

      The defaults can be set for the mode you like most.   Either mode
      works when working in the "one for one mode" where each ZCUT is
      followed by one ZPASTE.  If you set the default options to ADD
      and KEEP you will have to keep track of the contents of the ZCUT
      table (use the SHOWCUT macro) to know when to override the default
      option with ether REPLACE or ZERO or you will continue to
      accumulate lines.

                          ¢How to use SHOWCUT+
+
  %Specify which table to display, either
      a two character table name
      or the select from a list.+

      The lines from the ZCUT macro are saved in an ISPF table.
      Multiple tables can be created. Specify the two character
      table to be displayed.

      Don't supply a two character table name and the SHOWCUT macro
      will display the list of two character table names currently
      defined. Select one of the entries from the list to display the
      contents of the table.
