   The ZCUT and ZPASTE Edit macros provide a handy method to move data
   from one Edit session to another.  The ZCUT Default panel supports
   the definition of the MODE for the ZCUT operation and for setting
   the defaults for both ZCUT and ZPASTE for future operations.

   The mode for the ZCUT   operation is ether REPLACE or ADD.

   The mode for the ZPASTE operation is ether KEEP or ZERO.

   The ZCUT table name can also be set. Multiple ZCUT tables can be
   utilized at the same time.  A limit on the number of lines that are
   allowed to be saved can also be set.

   The default values for the ZCUT MODE, ZPASTE MODE, table name, and
   line limit value can also be set or altered.
